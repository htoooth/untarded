Why:

  WTF?! is all this tar -zb998asdf8 file.tar.gz madness?

  Untarring a file should be ridiculously easy.



INSTALL:
  
  1. Just take the 'untarded.rb' file and put it some where.
  
  2. Edit your .bashrc and add an alias with the untarded.rb path
  
       Example: alias untarded='ruby ~/scripts/untarded/untarded.rb'
    
  3. Install ruby if you don't alread have it.
    
       sudo apt-get install ruby


Untarded:
  
  Example useage (.gz):
    
    $ untarded filename.tar.gz
    
  Example useage (.bz):
  
    $ untarded filename.tar.bz
    
  freakin' a.


Q&A:

  Q: This just un-tar's files. You're an idiot.
  A: Well, that wasn't really a question, but yeah, I'm always un-taring 
     and not tarring so that wasn't a goal. Plus, tar's arguments seem 
     a lot less silly when tarrring.
     
  Q: This sucks, I can't do something.
  A: Also not a question, but you should Submit a bug or Request a feature.
     
  Q: Can you passed other arguments, when untaring?
  A: No.
  
  Q: Haven't you heard of unp, that python script that unpacks anything.
  A: Sure did. A little after I wrote this.
  
  Q: How does Untarded work?
  A: It just builds the silly commands, and hands them to tar.
